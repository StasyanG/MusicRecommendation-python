my songs bound by the realization of what it is that i get up for cuz it's not the sun not the day i do it for fear that i'll lose my perception in the long run losing the contrast proverbially of the night to the day's bright sun a curse is squeezing a ill verse to a 4-bar purse i couldn't spend or bend the rhyme pattern trying to represent with limited content then vent my feelings squeezed inside of these emcees see it's hard for me to hide the fact it's not interesting when i'm listening me and disappointment go together like cigarettes and nicotine and when it seems my dreams collide with the name on my place card i'll drop below the radar simply focus on the daystar it seems to me i'm hated because i choose to be creative i'm like a leper in a town of fools an outcast making statements against deception sending us all to hell worshipping the image of wealth with a poor image of self doing work causing hurt always writing verbs speak absurd when you heard how i say these

times me muggs and senen chillin' with the beastie boys smokin' lots of weed but it was time to hit the studio for another lp '93 black sunday hits with critical acclaim had a monster hit from insane in the brain topped the charts held the spot for six weeks to boot it was a trip to note that we was the first ones to do it in rap music but it was a feat none the less so we started gettin paid and i stopped smokin' stress '94 still in the door and we conquered many tours with rage against the machine house of pain and many more was even invited to woodstock some niggas from the block called up eric bobo and half a million rocked how could all this happen at 24 years of age half a million bouncin' to your shit from off the stage '95 i was alive and survived so far still tryin' to cope with bein' a rap star 'cos that's the type of shit that can really affect your mental this was evident in the way i broke the tempo with confusion i'm havin' illusions pain and hence illusions but i still kept my set up with the critics bein' abusive yeah even the record company they became illusive when it comes to showin' support for the cypress institution '96 with no support we were still makin' moves cypress hill in the summer we were on the smokin' grooves but like every legend every clique someone had to split so the dog left the house shit was gettin' kinda thick i was with the electric lady we was talkin' about babies but the groupies on the road don't help me from misbehavin' '97 was the trip it was the year we killed the feud between us and cube over shit nobody knew the dog came back home but after smokin' grooves 2 chillin' with george clinton and erykah badu this was a crazy time we were flowin' off the boo niggas on stage trippin' on the 'shrooms '98 was kinda great cos it felt just like before we hit the studio recorded cypress hill iv but someone dropped the ball as i still recall 'cos it felt cypress hill got no support at all we did the last smokin' grooves but did it all with sen and the old chemistry just reared it's head again '99 i got to recline because there was no doubt that the first year was a success of the smoke out '99 was even better than the year of '98 and skull and bones was comin' out kickin' from the gate 2000 15 million records sold they broke the mould but there's others along the road but we still keep rollin' on from heaven to atlantis droppin' shit in english and makin' albums in spanish 2001 goddamn who knows what's in store just as long as motherfuckers know who's knockin' on the door we remain unjaded and still we go unfaded see

mouth and pay close attention to what we're about to say my name is k and i'm your moderator in this great debate we're tackling a topic that's highly prevalent state to state to my left an evolutionist atheist he'll be stating his case against the man to my right who's a creationist for the sake of history a camera specialist is taping this did a deity create this or did we evolve as a basic gist you sir well the bible states in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth so everything we see here was his hand at work this man's a jerk i've read his books and seen his lectures even studied all his tapes about how we were lifeforms that evolved from apes i ask you how could a intelligent being come out of a lesser being this is the thing with which we're wrestling the universe and man are god's creation just admit it pop if we evolved from apes and apes are still around why did it stop were we created or did we evolve how did we arrive what's the purpose of our

what's the purpose of our existence why are we alive tell me who do you believe in to what do you subscribe ok your time is up you'll get a chance to talk some more but at this time we need to let our second speaker have the floor let's give the same respect to him and not speak all at once so we'll pass the baton to your opponent now for his response {well the concept of life evolving and the way that things were brought in was fathered and authored by charles darwin your assessment of what we believe was improperly covered we only speak of how one life form changes into another you believe in god but can't prove there's a god and this is vital your theology is based upon a contradicting bible you don't worship him you worship idols and hold self-righteous dispositions if god is real why is this world in this condition i feel humanity has had enough of this lie you praise a spirit that allows people to suffer and die and no matter how much you pray and look up to the sky things remain corrupt } alright your times up to rebut and reply were we created or did we evolve how did we arrive what's the purpose of our existence why are we alive tell me who do you believe in to what do you subscribe and when it's time for you to prove yourself how will you survive were we created or did we evolve how did we arrive what's the purpose of our existence why are we alive tell me who do you believe in to what do you subscribe right now this debate is winding down we're finding out some things now so we'll let the evolutionist start this time around {well as for the universe we've never said who made it evolution is not the theory of how life originated your failed connection and theory rejection is only evidence of your lack of comprehension in the process of natural selection} well motion and order are the first two laws of the universe we don't agree that stars and planets are the result of a big burst think of the perfect celestial trajectory how things operate successfully with intricate detailed complexity {can you believe this idiot sitting next to me see you're speaking scientifically prove god did it and break it down specifically} i've done that through the scriptures what you've heard is the truth whether it's bible or qur'an see god's word is the proof and i agree i'm speaking scientifically we're in compliance but my last question to you will be who
